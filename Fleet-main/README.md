Vendor Cab and Driver Onboarding & Vendor Hierarchy Management

This project is a dashboard for managing vendors, their drivers, cabs, and the overall vendor hierarchy.
The idea is to give a super vendor full control over multiple sub-vendors, and to make onboarding and monitoring easy.

It mainly focuses on:

Onboarding vendors, drivers, and vehicles

Maintaining multi-level hierarchy

Delegation and control for super vendors

Simple UI for viewing and managing data

⭐ What This Project Does
1. Vendor Hierarchy Management

The system supports multiple levels of vendors.
A Super Vendor can have many Sub-Vendors, and each of them can further have their own teams.

The hierarchy is displayed visually using React Flow, so you can clearly understand:

Who reports to whom

Which vendor owns which cabs and drivers

2. Vendor, Driver & Cab Onboarding

Each vendor can add:

New drivers

New vehicles

Basic details like name, ID, vehicle number, etc.

This keeps everything organized and helps in tracking fleet details.

3. Delegation by Super Vendor

Super vendors can:

Assign work to sub-vendors

View all vendors under them

Track activity and onboarded units

Monitor hierarchy visually

4. Simple Dashboard Pages

The project includes basic pages for:

Driver and vehicle tables

Delegation management

Vendor list

Vendor hierarchy tree

Dashboard summaries

These pages use mock data but represent how a real dashboard would function.
