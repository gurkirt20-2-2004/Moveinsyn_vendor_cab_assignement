->Vendor Cab and Driver Onboarding & Vendor Hierarchy Management

This project is a dashboard for managing vendors, their drivers, cabs, and the overall vendor hierarchy.
The idea is to give a super vendor full control over multiple sub-vendors, and to make onboarding and monitoring easy.

It mainly focuses on:

Onboarding vendors, drivers, and vehicles
Maintaining multi-level hierarchy
Delegation and control for super vendors
Simple UI for viewing and managing data

⭐ What This Project Does

1. Vendor Hierarchy Management
The system supports multiple levels of vendors.
A Super Vendor can have many Sub-Vendors, and each of them can further have their own teams.
The hierarchy is displayed visually using React Flow, so you can clearly understand:
Who reports to whom
Which vendor owns which cabs and drivers

2. Vendor, Driver & Cab Onboarding
Each vendor can add:
New drivers
New vehicles
Basic details like name, ID, vehicle number, etc.
This keeps everything organized and helps in tracking fleet details.

3. Delegation by Super Vendor
Super vendors can:
Assign work to sub-vendors
View all vendors under them
Track activity and onboarded units
Monitor hierarchy visually

4. Simple Dashboard Pages
The project includes basic pages for:
Driver and vehicle tables
Delegation management
Vendor list
Vendor hierarchy tree
Dashboard summaries
These pages use mock data but represent how a real dashboard would function.
